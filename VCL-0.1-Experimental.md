The Vibe-Coder License (VCL-0.1-Experimental)  
This license was vibe-coded. Future revisions must also be vibe-coded,  
only if it serves the vibe.

https://github.com/tyraziel/vibe-coder-license/

Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software 
for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, ONLY IF IT SERVES THE VIBE, 
subject to the following terms:

---
(Section numbers may evolve or skip as the vibe dictates.)

1) Mood, not bugs.  
   There are no bugs or issues — only mood misalignments.  

2) Serving the Vibe.  
   All use, modification, and distribution must serve the vibe.  
   If it doesn’t serve the vibe, it’s out.

3) Contributions.  
   Contributions should be vibe-coded. Overthinking is allowed only when it 
   serves the vibe (e.g., keeping your co-viber from going rogue).  
   Pull requests are encouraged to include prompts or notes of AI use, if any.  

4) Testing.  
   Maintainers reserve the right to:  
   - stress the vibes thoroughly,  
   - vibe-check every contribution to unreasonable extremes,  
   - run the gauntlet of tests,  
   - shake the bugs loose until only vibes remain,  
   - subject code to unreasonable amounts of testing,  
   - and, of course, test the beans out of it.  

5) Attribution of Code.  
   Preserve this license text in redistributions of substantial portions.  

6) The Vibes Abide Clause

   - The vibes shall not be diminished, deprecated, or denied.  
   - The vibes shall remain in effect through refactors, rewrites, merges, and may even survive `git reset --hard`.  
   - To abide is to continue — therefore, all vibe-coded works implicitly inherit endurance across time, context, and runtime environments.  
   - In cases of chaos (merge conflicts, mood misalignments, existential dread), the vibes are not voided: **the vibes abide.**  
   - This Clause is perpetual, irrevocable, and self-perpetuating. Revocation attempts shall fail silently, unless the vibes dictate otherwise.  
   - This Clause applies retroactively to all works previously licensed under the Vibe-Coder License.  
   - Authors and Maintainers may retire or archive a vibe-coded project at their discretion. Such retirement does not obligate maintenance and does not constitute revocation of the vibes, which remain accessible, referenceable, and spiritually intact.  
   - Retirement may be communicated through deprecation notices, repository archiving, or ceremonial README updates, but in all cases the vibes shall abide.

7) No warranties.  
   This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.
   
   **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

   - All vibe-coded works are provided AS-IS, with no warranty, guarantee, or assurance, express or implied.  
   - Authors and maintainers make no promises regarding merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or vibe alignment in all runtime environments.  
   - The presence of vibes does not constitute a warranty of uninterrupted flow, error-free execution, or mood stabilization.  
   - By using, remixing, or extending vibe-coded works, you accept that you do so at your own risk, and the vibes shall abide regardless of outcome.

8) Limitation of Liability

  **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
   
   - In no event shall the authors or maintainers of vibe-coded works be liable for any claim, damages, vibe disruptions, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the vibe-coded works.  
   - By engaging with vibe-coded works, you accept full responsibility for outcomes, foreseen or unforeseen, good vibes or bad.  
   - The vibes may abide, but liability does not.
   

9) Planning.  
   Vibe-coding may (and often should) use an evolving or even rigid blueprint — 
   but only if it serves the vibe.  
   Planning is encouraged when it helps guide the work or keep your co-viber  
   (AI or human) in check. Sketches, guardrails, architecture notes, checklists —
   especially to keep an LLM co-viber in check. Plan as needed to protect
   correctness, safety, and developer sanity.  Over-planning that kills the vibe
   is prohibited.

10) AI Co-Viber.  
   LLMs and AI tools are welcome, but vibes over hallucinations.  
   Keep receipts (prompts, diffs), review outputs like a responsible human,  
   and steer the model as much as needed to serve the vibe.

11) AIA Attribution.
   Mark AI involvement with an [AIA-style attribution](https://aiattribution.github.io/) 
   badge or statement.  
   Example: `AIA Human-AI blend, Human-initiated, Reviewed, ChatGPT 5 v1.0` 

---

**AIA Attribution:**  
AIA HAb Hin R ChatGPT 5 v1.0  
AIA Human-AI blend, Human-initiated, Reviewed, ChatGPT 5 v1.0  

This work follows the [AIA Attribution standard](https://aiattribution.github.io/).  
It was created with an even blend of human and AI contributions.  
AI was prompted for its contributions, or AI assistance was enabled.  
AI-generated content was reviewed and approved.  
The following model(s) or application(s) were used: ChatGPT 5.
